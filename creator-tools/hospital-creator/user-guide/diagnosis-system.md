# Diagnosis system

The **Diagnosis system** makes medical roleplay more realistic and challenging. Instead of simply reviving a patient using the F5 menu, doctors and EMS staff must first **examine the body** and treat the specific injuries before attempting a revival.

If the patient’s body is severely damaged, they cannot be revived until the injuries are properly treated. This ensures that each case requires correct diagnosis and use of medical tools.

***

## How to Diagnose a Patient

1. Open the **F5 radial menu**.
2. Select the **Diagnose** option.
3. A diagnosis screen will appear, showing the **body parts** and their damage level.
4. Review the **injuries report** at the bottom to see the type of wounds.

## Treating Injuries

To treat the patient, drag the correct medical item from your inventory to the affected body part. Each injury requires a **specific treatment item**, configured in `Config.TreatmentItems`:
