# Ambulance radial menu

In **Quasar Hospital Creator**, medical staff can access a **radial menu** that centralizes all ambulance-related actions in one place. This system ensures fast response times and a more immersive roleplay experience by giving EMS players direct access to the tools they need.

Whether it’s diagnosing an injury, reviving a patient, or transporting them to safety, the radial menu is designed to make every action intuitive and efficient.

***

## How to Open the Radial Menu

To access the ambulance functions, you must first be on duty as an **EMS job**. Once active, you can open the radial menu using your assigned key (by default this is usually `F5`).

After opening, the menu will display all available medical functions in a clear and accessible way.
