# Drugs Creator

Quasar Drugs Creator is an advanced system designed to revolutionize the way drugs are handled in FiveM Roleplay servers. This resource allows you to create fully customizable drugs with unique hallucinogenic effects, offering an immersive and dynamic experience for players.

With Quasar Drugs Creator, server owners can establish specific drug farming zones, enabling players to gather raw materials in interactive environments. These materials can then be processed in drug laboratories, which are purchasable by players. These labs are fully customizable, allowing players to decorate and organize them as they see fit, and strategically place processing spots for maximum efficiency.

The system also provides the ability to create drug buyers as the final step in the production chain, creating a realistic and engaging economy. With its robust customization options and immersive features, Quasar Drugs Creator brings a fresh level of depth and realism to the drug-related gameplay experience.
