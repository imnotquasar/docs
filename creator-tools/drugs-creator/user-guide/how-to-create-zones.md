# How to create zones

To create drug zones, you must have administrator privileges on your server. Follow these steps to set up new zones:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### **Accessing the Zone Creator Menu**

Use the command `/drugscreator` in the chat. This will open the **Drugs Creator Menu**, which allows you to configure and add zones for drug collection, processing, or packaging.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### **Choosing the Zone Type**

In the menu, you can select the type of zone you want to create:

* **Collection Zone**: For players to gather raw materials (e.g., weed plants, chemicals).
* **Processing Zone**: For players to process raw materials into usable drugs (e.g., cocaine or methamphetamine).
* **Packaging Zone**: For players to package processed drugs for sale.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### **Selecting the Drug Type**

After selecting the zone type, you will choose the specific drug that the zone will handle. For example:

* **Weed**
* **Meth**
* **Cocaine**
* **Heroine** (or any custom drug you’ve added).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### **Configuring the Zone**

The menu will guide you through configuring the zone, including:

* **Location**: Set the exact position of the zone.
* **Prop/Model**: Choose the visual object or marker to represent the zone (e.g., a weed plant for collection zones).
* **Zone Settings**: Define additional requirements like the number of police officers online (if required), timers, and the quantity players can collect or process.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### **Save and Finalize**

Once you’ve configured the zone, save the settings in the menu. The zone will now be active and ready for players to use.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## **Key Notes**

* You must be an administrator to access the `/drugscreator` menu and create zones.
* Ensure the zone type and drug type match your server's configuration to avoid errors.
* Always test the new zones after creating them to ensure functionality.
