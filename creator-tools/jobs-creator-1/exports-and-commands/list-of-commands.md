# List of commands

Each command has its explanation on the right side, if any command does not work, you can check if you used its syntax correctly, you can later claim it in a ticket.

<table><thead><tr><th width="342">Command</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>/cad</td><td>Open the police cad menu (dispatch, citizen search, radio, management, all interface....)</td></tr><tr><td>/policeadmin</td><td>Open the police admin interfeze (settings, markers placement, permissions, and more)</td></tr><tr><td>/rpol</td><td><pre><code>/rpol &#x3C;message>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
