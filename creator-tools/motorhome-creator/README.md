# Motorhome Creator

**Quasar Motorhome** transforms vehicles into fully customizable homes, bringing a new level of immersion to your FiveM server. Players can decorate and personalize interiors just like in Quasar Housing, enjoying comfort on the move with realistic camping systems, storage, and interactions. Whether it’s a car, boat, or plane, any vehicle can become a mobile base.

This asset supports immersive roleplay with crash detection, entry animations, and advanced security. Players can lock their motorhomes or face the risk of thieves attempting break-ins using lockpicks. With endless customization, smooth integration, and support for ESX and QBCore, **Quasar Motorhome** is perfect for those seeking adventure and comfort in motion — making it an essential addition for any server focused on realism and creativity.
