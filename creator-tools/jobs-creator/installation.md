## Update artifacts and gamebuild

Updating to the latest **artifacts** and **gamebuild** is essential to avoid common server issues. Here's how to do it properly:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Update Artifacts

> To find the best FiveM artifact, visit [artifacts.jgscripts.com](https://artifacts.jgscripts.com). Thanks to JG Scripts.

Completely replace your current artifacts with the latest version. Download the appropriate artifacts for your operating system from the official links:

* **Windows**: [Windows Artifacts](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/).
* **Linux**: [Linux Artifacts](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_proot_linux/master/).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Update Gamebuild

Using gamebuild 3095 is recommended as it is the most stable version, ensuring optimal performance and avoiding compatibility issues.

Edit the `server.cfg` file and add the following line:

```plaintext
sv_enforceGameBuild 3095
```
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

You can see the complete guide to update your server here:

{% content-ref url="../../development-guides/before-you-start/how-to-update-my-server.md" %}
[how-to-update-my-server.md](../../development-guides/before-you-start/how-to-update-my-server.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Server.cfg Positioning

This asset must always be started below your framework and inventory in your server.cfg. If you do not follow this order, you may encounter issues or even critical errors. It is highly recommended to start the entire download folder using "ensure \[jobscreator]" to ensure clean organization and proper initialization.

## **Database Installation**

For this step, we highly recommend using **HeidiSQL** to avoid issues, as it provides an updated version of MariaDB. We have a guide that explains step-by-step how to use HeidiSQL. If you choose to use phpMyAdmin, we will not be responsible for any errors that may occur in your database.

{% content-ref url="../../development-guides/before-you-start/how-to-install-heidisql.md" %}
[how-to-install-heidisql.md](../../development-guides/before-you-start/how-to-install-heidisql.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Quasar Jobs Creator sets up the database automatically. If needed, run /sql/\*.sql manually. Avoid changing SQL paths to prevent issues. For ESX or large marker databases, use /tools/cleanupdatabase.sql to optimize performance.\
\


### Setting permissions to use the script.

go to server.cfg and put the add ace command on it

```editorconfig
#Jobs_Creator
add_ace identifier.license:yourlicensehere jobcreator allow # Add permission to 'emanu' Rockstar license
```
