# Housing Creator

**Quasar Housing 4.0** is the definitive housing system for FiveM, bringing unmatched customization, realism, and server-side control to virtual properties. Redesigned from the ground up, it introduces an immersive experience where players can fully decorate, modify, and personalize their homes with drag-and-drop furniture, RGB lighting, dynamic storage areas, and more.

The system also includes a powerful real estate framework for buying, selling, and managing ownership — ideal for both RP and economy-based servers. Server owners can define zones, control pricing, and automate access, while players enjoy seamless interactions and visually stunning interiors. Whether it’s a luxury apartment, a humble cabin, or a gang hideout, Quasar Housing 4.0 adapts to your server’s needs.

With integrated DLC support and smooth performance, this is more than just housing — it’s a full living experience tailored for the modern FiveM roleplayer, featuring high-quality custom shells thanks to our collaboration with **SubhaMPro**.
