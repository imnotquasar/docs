# How to plant weed

To grow drugs, you can use specific seed items within your own house. If the house does not belong to you, or you are outside a house, planting will not be possible. Police can also burn plants grown by other players, adding an element of risk.

## Plantable seeds items

These are the seeds as an object that we can plant:

* weed\_white-widow\_seed
* weed\_skunk\_seed
* weed\_purple-haze\_seed
* weed\_og-kush\_seed
* weed\_amnesia\_seed
* weed\_ak47\_seed

Once the plants reach their maximum size, they will require the item `empty_weed_bag` to harvest. To ensure proper growth, you must periodically use `weed_nutrition` to care for the plants.
