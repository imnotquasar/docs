# Motels Creator

**Quasar Motels Creator** is a comprehensive motel management system for FiveM, giving server owners the tools to create immersive and functional motel experiences across the map. Players can rent rooms, set up temporary homes, and interact with key features such as wardrobes, stashes, and vehicle parking. Every motel can be customized individually, offering different layouts, prices, and locations.

The system supports advanced roleplay mechanics including permanent or temporary rentals, automatic cleaning cycles, and key systems for guest access. Whether players are staying short-term or managing motels as a business, the system brings realism and depth to your server’s housing ecosystem. Designed with smooth performance and compatibility in mind, it integrates perfectly with **ESX**, **QBCore**, and other major resources. With **Quasar Motels Creator**, you can turn any building into an interactive and valuable space for your players — expanding both roleplay opportunities and server immersion.
