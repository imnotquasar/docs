# Permissions Management

This section details the responsibilities and capabilities of motel owners and workers within the system. It explains how owners can manage staff, configure permissions, and oversee motel operations, while also outlining the tasks workers can perform if granted permission.

Both roles have configurable access to essential features, such as room management, financial transactions, and customer interactions, allowing for a flexible and dynamic motel management experience.
