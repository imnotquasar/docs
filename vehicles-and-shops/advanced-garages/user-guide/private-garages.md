# Private Garages

Private garages allow players to manage and customize their own garages, offering control over who can access them and how they are used. These garages enable a personalized experience where players can store, deposit, and manage their vehicles securely.

***

## **Getting Started**

To use private garages, you must first create one by following the steps outlined in the **Create Garages** documentation. Once created, private garages can be fully managed using in-game commands.

***

## **Managing Your Private Garage**

As the owner of a private garage, you can access its management menu using the `/garagemenu` command. This menu provides the following options:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### **Sell the Garage**

If you no longer need the garage, you can sell it directly through this menu.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### **Invite Other Players**

Share access to your garage by giving keys to other players. However, they can only deposit and retrieve their own vehiclesâ€”your vehicles remain inaccessible to them.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
