# Creating Garages

Quasar Advanced Garages provides an intuitive system for creating garages directly in-game, tailored to jobs configured in the `config.lua` file. This allows seamless garage setup with minimal effort.

## **Garage Creation Command**

Permissions for garage creation are configurable, and by default, mechanics are authorized to use the command. Administrators can adjust these permissions to suit their server's structure.

To create a garage, use the `/creategaragemenu` command. This will open an interactive menu where you can specify the garage's parameters, such as location and type. After completing the setup, the garage will appear on the map and be ready for use.
