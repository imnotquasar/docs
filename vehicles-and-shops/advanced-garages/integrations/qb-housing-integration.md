# qb-housing integration

If you wish to integrate the advanced garage system with your housing system, follow this guide. However, please note that any modifications are at your own risk.

***

## **Recommended Approach**

We strongly recommend downloading our version of the housing system, which is the latest update released by the QBCore community. It has been tested and works seamlessly with Quasar Advanced Garages. If you choose to edit your existing version and encounter issues, the problem likely stems from your changes, as the default version functions correctly.

## **Supported Housing System**
