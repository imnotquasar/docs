## **How Does the Album Work?**

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### **Album as an Item**

* The album is represented by the item `tradingcard_stash`.
* This item functions as a storage container for your cards, similar to a stash.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### **Adding Cards to the Album**

* When using a card item, an **ox\_lib menu** will appear.
* The menu provides two options:
  * **Show the Card**: Display the card for other players.
  * **Store in Album**: Place the card into an available slot in the album if you have one in your inventory.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### **Removing Cards from the Album**

* To remove a card from the album, simply click on the card.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### **Trading and Sharing Albums**

* The album contains **metadata** that tracks its contents.
* This allows players to **trade or gift albums** to others, including all stored cards.
