# Change Positions or Map

One of the key features of the **Diamond Casino** script is its high level of configurability, allowing administrators to customize the positions within the map according to their needs. Thanks to the scriptâ€™s structure, this process is easy to implement.

Users will be able to access a wide variety of configurations within the `qs-diamondcasino/config/` folder. Here, they will find numerous coordinates that can be adjusted to modify the positions of elements on the map. This includes the locations of objects, NPCs, and key areas of the casino.

Although the script is compatible with custom maps, **we recommend using the map included in the package**. This map not only offers a unique experience with its details and design, but also includes features like **customizable walls** and other options that enhance the casino environment. Using this custom map ensures better integration and a smoother in-game experience.
