# Text UI

**Quasar Text UI** is the most optimized 3D text rendering system for FiveM, designed to completely replace outdated DrawText3D methods. Whether you’re adding labels, prompts, or real-time messages, this system ensures ultra-smooth performance without dropping FPS — even on low-end machines.

Built with customization in mind, it lets you style your in-game text exactly how you want: change fonts, colors, sizes, positions, and add animations for dynamic effects. Use it to display instructions, NPC labels, job hints, and much more.

Unlike resource-heavy alternatives, **Quasar Text UI** is lightweight and efficient, meaning lower client usage and a more polished experience for all players. Whether you're enhancing your RP server or adding functionality to custom scripts, this system offers the flexibility, looks, and speed modern servers need.
