## Update artifacts and gamebuild

Updating to the latest **artifacts** and **gamebuild** is essential to avoid common server issues. Here's how to do it properly:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Update Artifacts

> To find the best FiveM artifact, visit [artifacts.jgscripts.com](https://artifacts.jgscripts.com). Thanks to JG Scripts.

Completely replace your current artifacts with the latest version. Download the appropriate artifacts for your operating system from the official links:

* **Windows**: [Windows Artifacts](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/).
* **Linux**: [Linux Artifacts](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_proot_linux/master/).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Update Gamebuild

Using gamebuild 3095 is recommended as it is the most stable version, ensuring optimal performance and avoiding compatibility issues.

Edit the `server.cfg` file and add the following line:

```plaintext
sv_enforceGameBuild 3095
```
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

You can see the complete guide to update your server here:

{% endcontent-ref %}

## Server.cfg Positioning

This asset must always be started below your framework and inventory. Failure to do so may result in functionality issues or critical errors. To ensure smooth operation and proper initialization, it is recommended to start the entire download folder using "ensure \[textui]" in your server.cfg.

## Automatic Integration in all Quasar Scripts

Quasar Text UI seamlessly integrates with all **qs scripts** without additional configuration. Simply start it **before other scripts** in your `server.cfg`, and it will automatically adapt to your server's needs.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Automatic Adaptation

The script will **automatically integrate** with other `qs` scripts without additional configuration.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Optional Customization

If you need to modify any parameters, navigate to `client/custom/framework/*`
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

Thatâ€™s it! **Quasar Text UI** is now fully integrated and ready to use.

## Integration in qbcore and esx

We can seamlessly integrate this system by default in both QB and ESX frameworks using the following code snippets. If your framework does not include these events, you can refer to the **"User Guides"** section for detailed instructions on how to adapt this system to any other script.

<details>

<summary>Integration in qbcore</summary>

```lua
-- qb-core/client/drawtext.lua

exports['qb-core']:DrawText() => exports["qs-textui"]:displayTextUI(text, position)

exports['qb-core']:HideText() => exports["qs-textui"]:hideTextUI()

exports['qb-core']:KeyPressed() => Dont change it

exports['qb-core']:ChangeText() => exports['qs-textui']:changeText(text, position)
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Integration in esx</summary>

```lua
-- es_extended/client/functions.lua

function ESX.TextUI(...)
    return IsResourceFound('esx_textui') and exports['esx_textui']:TextUI(...)
end

---@return nil
function ESX.HideUI()
    return IsResourceFound('esx_textui') and exports['esx_textui']:HideUI()
end

-- Set them to these:

function ESX.TextUI(...)
    return exports["qs-textui"]:displayTextUI(...)
end

---@return nil
function ESX.HideUI()
    return exports["qs-textui"]:hideTextUI()
end
```
