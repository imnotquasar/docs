# Create Invoice Event

The **Create Invoice** section explains how to generate invoices for players on your server. It covers the parameters and process for creating detailed and customizable invoices, either manually through commands or programmatically using exports. This system supports linking invoices to societies, marking them as paid or unpaid, and even delivering them as in-game items for better roleplay integration.
