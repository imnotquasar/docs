# In-Game Interface Editor

Quasar Interface includes an in-game editor that allows players to modify hud settings at any time.

***

## **Keybind Configuration**

To open the editor, players can refer to the **keybinds guide** at the beginning of the documentation. However, if they want to change the default key, they can do so by editing the **config.lua** file, where the default key is **F9**.

[how-to-change-key-bindings.md](../../../development-guides/configure-your-scripts/how-to-change-key-bindings.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## **Cinematic Mode & Menu Disabling**

This menu also features a **cinematic mode**, which can be disabled by adjusting the `Config.EnableCinematicMode` option. If you prefer to disable the editing menu entirely, you can do so using the `Config.ConfigurationMenu` option.
