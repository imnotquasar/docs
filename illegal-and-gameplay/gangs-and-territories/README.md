# Gangs and Territories

**Quasar Gangs & Territories** is a powerful system that transforms gang management and territorial control in FiveM. Players can create custom gangs, manage ranks, access exclusive garages and stashes, and control every aspect through an intuitive admin panel. Each gang operates independently, offering unique perks, upgrades, and responsibilities within the server’s criminal ecosystem.

Territories become battlegrounds where gangs fight for control, deliver drugs, and complete dealer missions to gain reputation and income. The more influence a gang has, the more powerful it becomes. The system includes full support for **ESX** and **QBCore**, and requires **ox\_lib** for optimal performance and customization. Whether you’re running a hardcore crime RP server or a dynamic economy-based experience, **Quasar Gangs & Territories** brings structure, immersion, and endless gameplay potential for criminal organizations.
