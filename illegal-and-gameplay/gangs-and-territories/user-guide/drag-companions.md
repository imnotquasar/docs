A standout feature in the Quasar Gangs & Territories system is the ability to drag wounded companions during gang fights. This allows players to move injured allies to a safer location, providing a strategic advantage in ongoing battles.

When a companion is killed in a gang fight, you can interact with their body and use the designated key to drag them to safety. This functionality ensures the survival of your team while enhancing immersion during intense territory battles.
