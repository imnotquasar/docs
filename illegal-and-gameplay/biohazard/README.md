# Biohazard

Quasar Biohazard is a standalone zombie survival event for your FiveM server. Once activated, one player becomes infected and turns into a zombie: their mission is to spread the virus by touching others. Survivors must resist and avoid infection as chaos unfolds. Dynamic, thrilling, and easy to integrate, this system guarantees hours of fun and intense roleplay in every session.
