# GetPlayerInfo

The **GetPlayerInfo** export allows you to retrieve detailed information about a specific player by their player ID. This is particularly useful for server-side operations that require dynamic access to player data.

***

## How to Use

To get a player's information, pass their player ID and a callback function to the export:

```lua
exports['qs-dispatch']:GetPlayerInfo(playerID, function(playerData)
    if playerData then
        print("Player coordinates: " .. tostring(playerData.coords))
        print("Nearby street: " .. playerData.street_1)
        print("Player vehicle: " .. (playerData.vehicle_label or "None"))
    else
        print("Failed to retrieve player info.")
    end
end)
```

* **ped**: Player's character identifier.
