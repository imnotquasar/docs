# Penitencial System

The **Penitentiary System** introduces a **GTA V-style chase system with wanted stars**, activated when criminal charges are assigned to a player and they manage to escape. This system works independently and integrates seamlessly with your police workflow.

***

## Key Features

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Chase System

Players assigned criminal charges who escape will trigger a chase system with visual search stars. (Currently manual, automatic assignment is coming soon.)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Standalone Jail System

This system does not require any external jail scripts, making it fully functional on its own.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Customizable Settings

The configuration allows you to:

* Specify jobs permitted to send players to jail.
* Set jail locations and prisoner spawn/exit points.
* Manage illegal items confiscated upon arrest.
* Adjust how long search stars persist out of camera view.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Default Compatibility

This feature is only active if `Config.MDT.newMdt` is set to `false`.
