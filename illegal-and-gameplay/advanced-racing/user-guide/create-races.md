# Create Races

Anyone can create races! To do this, access the menu by pressing **F10** (default) or using the tablet if configured that way. Navigate to the **Creation** section and open the **Guide Points** dropdown. Get in a car and start building your race tracks.

## How do I make the race competitive? <a href="#how-do-i-make-the-race-competitive" id="how-do-i-make-the-race-competitive"></a>

Once a race is created, you'll see a âœ“ symbol in the race list. Marking this option allows the race to be made competitive, which is the only way to earn ELO points. Only administrators can verify and enable a race for competitive mode.
