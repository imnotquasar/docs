# Backrooms

**Quasar Backroom** immerses players into a surreal and terrifying realm inspired by the eerie lore of the backrooms and the SCP universe. Upon death, players have a configurable chance to be transported into this alternate dimension, where logic fades and unknown horrors await. Strange corridors, unsettling sound design, and unpredictable NPC creatures make every moment tense and immersive.

The system includes damage zones, escape mechanics, and dynamic exit portals, allowing server owners to customize how long players remain trappedâ€”or if they ever make it out. Whether used as a punishment system, a horror event, or a hidden realm to discover, **Quasar Backroom** adds a chilling new layer of gameplay that blends fear, mystery, and survival into your FiveM experience.
