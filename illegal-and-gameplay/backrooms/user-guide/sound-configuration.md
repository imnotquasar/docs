# Sound Configuration

Upon entering the Backrooms we will find a very muddy sound, this is a configurable song that we can edit using config.lua, here we will leave you a brief example.

## Basic sound configuration <a href="#basic-sound-configuration" id="basic-sound-configuration"></a>

At the beginning of the backroom you will have a background sound to give more suspense to the tour, this sound is fully configurable, add another youtube link with the sound that you think scares you the most and have fun.

```lua
Config.Sound = { -- Custom sound with 'xsound'
    link = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCOG2vyfcAA', -- Choose your YouTube link without copyright
    distance = 15.0, -- Ignore
}
```
