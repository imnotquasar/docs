# NPC Interact

**Quasar Interact** is an advanced interaction system for FiveM that redefines how players engage with NPCs, objects, and other players. Forget basic menus — this system offers immersive, context-aware interactions with smooth animations and logic that adapts to every scenario. From picking up items to arresting NPCs or opening doors, every action feels natural and fluid.

Built for maximum flexibility, the system auto-detects what players are targeting and presents the appropriate interaction — no need for complex commands. Whether you're designing civilian mechanics, police systems, or immersive RP experiences, **Quasar Interact** is your toolkit for deeper gameplay.

With full support for radial menus, key-based actions, and custom prompts, every server can tailor it to fit their exact vision. Lightweight, responsive, and fully customizable, it’s the ultimate interaction solution for modern FiveM servers.
