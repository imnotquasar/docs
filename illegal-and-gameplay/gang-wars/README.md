# Gang Wars

Quasar Gangwars is a revolutionary system that brings conquerable territories to your FiveM server, allowing gangs to take control of key zones in the city. By conquering a territory, gangs can collect resources like drugs and earn special benefits such as double the resources if they own the zone. This feature-packed system fosters intense competition between factions, making every conquest a strategic move towards controlling the cityâ€™s economy.
