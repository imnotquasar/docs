# Camera

**Quasar Camera** is an immersive photography system for FiveM that lets players capture, store, and share in-game moments with unmatched realism. Every photo taken becomes a unique item with metadata, viewable in a 3D gallery and transferable between players. The camera features smooth animations, working flash sync, zoom control, and even durabilityâ€”meaning it can break and be repaired, adding a new layer of roleplay.

Photos can be connected to webhooks for Discord sharing or used as physical evidence in RP scenarios. Whether you're a journalist, detective, or influencer, **Quasar Camera** offers a rich and engaging toolset that transforms photography into a dynamic experience. Fully compatible with ESX and QBCore, it's the perfect addition for servers seeking deeper interaction and realism.
