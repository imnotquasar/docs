# Create a lobby

In Quasar Deathmatch Creator, creating a Deathmatch lobby is a straightforward process that allows you to customize various aspects of the match. Below are the steps and features you will interact with when setting up a lobby.

***

## Access the Deathmatch menu <a href="#access-the-deathmatch-menu" id="access-the-deathmatch-menu"></a>

Once in the Deathmatch menu, you will be presented with the option to either join an existing lobby or **create your own custom lobby**. To start a new Deathmatch, select the **"Create Lobby"** option.

***

## Customize your lobby <a href="#customize-your-lobby" id="customize-your-lobby"></a>

After choosing to create a lobby, you can customize several key settings for the match:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### **Weapons Selection**

Choose the weapons that will be available to players during the match. You can either allow players to vote on the weapons or pre-select specific loadouts for each team.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### **Map Selection**

Select from a variety of maps, or even custom maps, where the deathmatch will take place. This feature allows for dynamic play across different environments.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### **Rounds and Game Mode**

Set the number of rounds and game mode rules. For example, you can create elimination-based matches with multiple rounds, or set a simple "first to X kills" rule.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### **Private or Public Lobby**

Choose whether the lobby will be open to all players or private with a password. If private, you will need to set a **password** that players must enter to join.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Team setup and player wait <a href="#team-setup-and-player-wait" id="team-setup-and-player-wait"></a>

Each lobby supports up to 5 players per team, for a total of 10 players in the match. Once you've customized your lobby, the system will automatically wait for players to join both teams.

* Players can either manually join through the lobby list, or you can invite them if the lobby is private.

***

## Start the match <a href="#start-the-match" id="start-the-match"></a>

Once the minimum player count (5 per team) has been reached, the match will automatically begin. Before the match starts, there is a cinematic sequence that showcases both competing teams. This adds an immersive, competitive element to the start of the match.

***

## Battle begins <a href="#battle-begins" id="battle-begins"></a>

After the cinematic, players will be placed into the match, and the Deathmatch battle will commence according to the settings you've configured.

This flexible lobby creation system allows for a fully customizable Deathmatch experience, perfect for PvP-focused servers looking to introduce intense, high-stakes battles.
