**DLCs (Downloadable Content)** are additional files or features designed to enhance the functionality of a main asset. They can unlock extra capabilities, add new content, or improve existing systems. For example, the **Quasar Inventory** system offers DLCs that elevate your serverâ€™s experience with advanced features. However, only the original purchaser of an asset can access its DLCs.
