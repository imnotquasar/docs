## **Avoiding update errors**

If you experience errors after updating, it’s often better to re-download and replace the entire asset. Remember to make a backup of your old files before doing this, as partial updates or incorrectly applied patches can break multiple parts of the asset.

### Full Replacement

### Backup Your Files

Always create a backup of your existing files before updating to ensure you can restore your setup if needed.
