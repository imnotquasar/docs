# Upgrading an old script

## Discontinued Assets Notification

If you're downloading an older asset from your Keymaster, you may find an empty file named **\[asset-discontinued]** instead of the actual asset files. This happens because some of our older assets have been officially discontinued or replaced with upgraded versions.

***

## Why Does This Happen?

Over time, some assets have been retired or replaced with newer, enhanced versions. If your asset is discontinued, the system will no longer provide the original files, and you'll see this placeholder file.

## Special Cases

For assets replaced with a different product (e.g., upgrading from **Smartphone** to **Smartphone Pro**), the replacement may involve a separate purchase or an upgrade fee, as they are considered entirely new products.
