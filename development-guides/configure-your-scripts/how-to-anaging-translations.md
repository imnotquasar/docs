## **Translation System**

All Quasar Store assets are designed with multilingual support to help you adapt them to your preferred language. Translations are stored in a folder called **local**, making it easy to manage and customize the language of your assets.

## **Where To Find Translations**

* The default translation files are located in the **local** folder of each asset.
* In some cases, translation strings might be stored in other configurable files. Be sure to check these files when translating your asset.
