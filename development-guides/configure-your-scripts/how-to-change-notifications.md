## **Editing Notifications**

All configurable notifications are located in client/custom/framework/\*.lua in this file, youâ€™ll find the SendTextMessage function, which controls how notifications are displayed.

If you want to customize the notification system or integrate a new one, you can do so by editing the SendTextMessage function. Below is an example of how to modify it for a new system:

```lua
function SendTextMessage(msg, type)
    if type == 'inform' then
        exports['qs-notify']:Alert(msg, 1500, 'info')
    end
    if type == 'error' then
        exports['qs-notify']:Alert(msg, 1500, 'error')
    end
    if type == 'success' then
        exports['qs-notify']:Alert(msg, 1500, 'success')
    end
end
```
