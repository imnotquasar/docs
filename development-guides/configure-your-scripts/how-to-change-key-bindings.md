# How to change key bindings

## **Register Key Mapping**

{% hint style="info" %}
The new keybinds will apply only to new players or those who reset their keybinds manually.
{% endhint %}

To properly organize your keybinds and optimize your resource, weâ€™ve adopted the FiveM native RegisterKeyMapping. This eliminates the need for constant checks (while loops) for key presses, significantly improving performance. This native works by triggering the associated chat command whenever the keybind is pressed.
