# Garbage Job

**Quasar Garbage Job** is a highly immersive trash collection system that adds realism, teamwork, and interactive roleplay to your FiveM server. Players can take on the role of sanitation workers, driving garbage trucks along custom routes, picking up trash from designated bins, and getting paid for keeping the city clean.

Designed for cooperative play, this job encourages teams to complete tasks efficiently with real-time progress tracking, animations, and optimized server performance. Every route is fully customizable, allowing server owners to tailor job length, rewards, and collection points to fit their RP economy.

**Quasar Garbage Job** integrates seamlessly with major frameworks like QBCore and ESX, and it’s easy to configure for solo or multiplayer sessions. Whether you’re running a city-focused RP server or want to expand your civilian job options, this script delivers a fun, functional, and community-driven experience.
