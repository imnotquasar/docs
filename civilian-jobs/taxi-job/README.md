# Taxi Job

**Quasar Taxi Job** transforms public transport into an immersive and rewarding roleplay experience for FiveM servers. Players can take passengers across the city, using a fully functional and customizable taximeter that tracks distance, time, and pricing — all while offering legal and illegal ride options depending on the RP scenario.

Missions include both NPC and player pickups, dynamic destinations, and a built-in leveling system that rewards progression and unlocks bonuses. Whether it’s a casual day job or part of a secret smuggling gig, **Quasar Taxi Job** adapts to every type of server.

It supports QBCore and ESX, features realistic animations, tip systems, GPS integration, and flexible vehicle settings. Whether your players want a legit fare or something more underground, this script adds depth, realism, and variety to your server’s job ecosystem.
