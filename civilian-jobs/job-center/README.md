# Job Center

**Quasar Job Center** is a next-gen employment hub that redefines how players find work in FiveM. Through a sleek, NPC-based interface, users can explore job categories, view role details, and instantly message employers in real time â€” all from within your server.

Compatible with ESX, QBCore, QBox, and standalone setups, it features auto-detection for easy installation and supports over 25 languages via its integrated localization system. Whether hiring is instant, via chat, or linked externally, the flexibility is yours.

Managers can access a dedicated boss tablet to handle applications, view chat history, track statuses, and get live alerts on new messages. With GPS integration, grade-based permissions, and multi-job control, Job Center keeps everything organized, immersive, and effortless.
