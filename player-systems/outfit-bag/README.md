# Outfit Bag

**Quasar Outfit Bag** is a powerful outfit management system that gives players the freedom to store, equip, and share outfits anytime, anywhere. With portable bags and seamless integration, players can carry multiple outfits and switch looks on the go.

The script features full auto-detection of your framework (ESX, QBCore, QBox, or Standalone) and targeting system, requiring zero manual setup. It also supports 25+ languages out of the box, making it globally accessible.

Outfits can be stored in public or private bags, with full clothing and accessory data saved. Server owners can set job-restricted or default bags for specific roles or locations. Whether for RP depth or player convenience, Outfit Bag brings stylish control to your serverâ€™s wardrobe system.
