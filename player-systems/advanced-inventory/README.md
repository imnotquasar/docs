# Advanced Inventory

Quasar Advanced Inventory is more than just an inventory system — it's a full RPG platform built into your FiveM server. Featuring a completely redesigned interface, it introduces a mission system directly tied to items, unlockable skill trees with both active and passive upgrades, and an immersive pause menu that displays real-time character stats. The focus is on delivering a deeper, smoother, and more advanced gameplay experience without sacrificing performance or compatibility with frameworks like QBCore and ESX. It’s a complete evolution in how players interact with the world around them.
