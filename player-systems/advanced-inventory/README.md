# Advanced Inventory

**Quasar Advanced Inventory** is more than an inventory — it’s a full-featured RPG framework for FiveM. Packed with a sleek drag-and-drop UI, skill trees, quest systems, and customizable shops, it transforms item management into an immersive core gameplay loop. Every interaction is dynamic: right-click menus, rarity highlights, and item-based missions make your inventory the center of the player experience.

From RPG-style skill progression to metadata-based clothing and integrated missions, this system goes far beyond traditional inventories. Compatible with QBCore, ESX, and standalone, it's fully optimized for performance and immersion. Players can upgrade, complete quests, and explore new systems — all through your inventory.

With advanced customization options, a unique pause menu, redesigned stores, and support for custom animations and scripts, **Quasar Advanced Inventory** redefines what’s possible in roleplay gameplay.
