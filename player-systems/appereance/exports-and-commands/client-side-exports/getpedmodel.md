# getPedModel

The `getPedModel` export allows you to retrieve the internal model identifier of a given ped entity. This is useful when you need to identify the pedâ€™s base model (such as male, female, or any custom ped) in order to apply logic, customization, or compatibility checks.

***

## How to Use

To get the model name of any ped entity, use the following code:

```lua
local ped = PlayerPedId()
local model = exports['qs-appearance']:getPedModel(ped)

print("Ped model:", model)
```

This export returns a string representing the model name associated with the given ped, such as `"mp_m_freemode_01"`. The function automatically initializes internal mappings if they haven't been computed yet, ensuring consistent results across uses.
