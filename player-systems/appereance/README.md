**Quasar Appearance** is the ultimate all-in-one customization system for FiveM. It combines clothing shops, barbershops, tattoo parlors, surgeons, and mask stores into a single, powerful script — perfect for immersive roleplay servers and optimized for full control over every detail of your characters.

From headgear-clipping prevention to live image capture for clothing items, every feature is designed with ease of use and server performance in mind. Manage stock, arms visibility, and even NPC shops with a simple and intuitive setup.

Whether you're creating high-end fashion stores or gritty back-alley tattoo spots, **Quasar Appearance** gives you the tools to do it — with full support for ESX, QBCore, and standalone.
