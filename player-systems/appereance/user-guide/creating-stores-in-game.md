# Creating Stores In-Game

This system allows you to create and manage shops directly from within the game using admin commands. Itâ€™s a fast and intuitive way to place clothing-related stores in the world without modifying configuration files manually.

## Create Stores In-Game

By using the `/create_shop` command, you can easily create any of the supported store types (clothing, barber, tattoo, surgeon, or clothingroom). The system will first ask you to define the interaction zone where the floating text will appear. Once confirmed, the store will be created and ready to use instantly.

## Delete Stores In-Game

To delete a store, simply use the `/delete_shop` command while standing inside the zone you want to remove. If you're unsure where the zones are (since they are invisible by default), you can enable `Config.Debug = true` to highlight all store areas on the map.
