# Edit Store Stock

This feature allows administrators to manage the clothing stock of each store individually, directly from the in-game clothing menu. It’s perfect for customizing the shopping experience and organizing different types of stores based on theme or style.

When an administrator opens the clothing menu in-game, they will see a **shield icon** at the top of the NUI interface. Clicking this icon will open the stock management panel for the current store.

From there, admins can **add or remove individual clothing items** available at that specific location. This is useful for removing broken or duplicate entries, or for creating themed shops—such as one for sportswear and another for formal clothing.

Each store has its own independent inventory, allowing full control over what items are offered in each location.
