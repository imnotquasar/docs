# GetGangAccount

The `GetGangAccount` export retrieves detailed information about a specific gang bank account using its name. This includes current balance and other related data. Itâ€™s useful for managing and displaying gang finances in scripts involving criminal activities or gang systems.

## How to Use

To get data from a gang account, pass the account name:

```lua
-- Example usage:
local accountName = "ballas_account"
local gangAccountData = exports['qs-banking']:GetGangAccount(accountName)

if gangAccountData then
    print("Gang balance: " .. gangAccountData.balance)
else
    print("Gang account not found")
end
```

This export is ideal for gang management systems, heist scripts, or any feature requiring real-time access to shared criminal funds.
