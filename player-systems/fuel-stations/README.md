# Fuel Stations

**Quasar Fuel Stations** is a fully custom fuel system for FiveM, inspired by LegacyFuel but rebuilt from scratch with modern functionality and realism in mind. Players can refuel vehicles using interactive gas station nozzles or portable fuel cans, all with immersive animations and seamless UX — enhancing every server’s roleplay experience.

This system is designed to be a plug-and-play replacement for LegacyFuel with no need to rewrite existing exports. It auto-detects and integrates directly into your current setup. Whether you run an economy server or a heavy RP environment, **Quasar Fuel Stations** brings both realism and flexibility with smart consumption logic, job integrations, and full customization.

From casual users to advanced developers, this system offers the compatibility, polish, and ease-of-use that servers demand today. Ready to fuel up your gameplay? This is the upgrade your vehicle system needs.
