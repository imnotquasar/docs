# Realistic Gym

**Quasar Realistic Gym** is a fully interactive fitness system that lets players train their character's strength and stamina through fun and immersive workouts. From push-ups to bench presses, each exercise features detailed animations and progression mechanics.

The system auto-detects your framework and targeting setup, requiring no manual configuration. With support for over 25 languages, it's ready for global deployment out of the box.

Players can access a full gym experience with bodyweight and weight training stations, all tied to a configurable stat system. Daily stat decay, a membership-based entry system with NPC reception, and visual stat tracking make this gym both realistic and rewarding — adding long-term progression to your server’s RP.
