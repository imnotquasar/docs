# Vehicle Keys

Quasar Vehiclekeys is an asset that allows you to give keys as items with the unique feature of item metadata. These will make each item unique and exclusive for a certain vehicle.

This asset is extremely extensive and detailed, as it plays with GTA V natives for incredible realism, allowing players to steal vehicles with mini-games, turn the vehicle on or off, give and take keys in item format and much more.

If you want to use this package, you'll rely on a metadata-based inventory, but you'll enjoy one of FiveM's nicest and biggest key systems.
