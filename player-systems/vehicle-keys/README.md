# Vehicle Keys

**Quasar Vehicle Keys** is an immersive and advanced system that introduces realistic key-based vehicle control to your FiveM server. Each key is a unique item linked to a specific vehicle using metadata, allowing players to lock, unlock, and start vehicles with full control. All vehicles are locked by default, ensuring a secure and authentic gameplay environment.

The system features smooth animations, light flashes when locking or unlocking, and integrates optional mini-games for theft attempts. NPCs will react dynamically, fleeing if their vehicle is targeted, while law enforcement is notified through dispatch integration. Players can also craft custom license plates and assign keys to vehicles, with support for vehicle chargers to enhance roleplay. **Quasar Vehicle Keys** is the ultimate upgrade for any server seeking a more realistic and engaging vehicle system.
