# Smartphone PRO

**Smartphone PRO** is a complete revolution in mobile systems for FiveM. Featuring full metadata integration, it allows you to access another player’s phone and retrieve detailed data like accounts, registered numbers, and more — with automatic phone locking for security. No more lost accounts: the recovery system lets users retrieve apps and passwords, just like in real life.

Go further with app development using the included **custom-phone-temple**, a full template for creating your own in-game apps with snippets and examples. From custom tools to social media, the possibilities are endless.

Unlike the Lite version, **Smartphone PRO** includes everything in one powerful package — no need for separate DLC. With dozens of minigames, widgets, voice notes, media sharing, and RP-focused apps, it redefines realism and customization. Whether you're a player or server owner, this is the ultimate phone system built for total control.
