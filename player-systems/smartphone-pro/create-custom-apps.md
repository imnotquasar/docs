The **Smartphone PRO** includes an open-source system for creating custom applications, allowing developers to easily build and integrate apps into the phone's App Store. Custom apps automatically run on the phone when started on the server.

A template app, **custom-app-temple**, is included in the package to simplify development. It provides snippets, events, and examples for app creation, including menu functionality, exclusive inputs, and more. The template works out of the box and appears in the App Store when started.
