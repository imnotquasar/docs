# Restart phone cache

If you update your asset or encounter issues with apps or downloads, you can reset the app cache using specific commands. This will not affect existing accounts but will restore default apps and clear cache-related issues.

***

## **Purpose:**

* Fix issues with app translations or modified settings not updating.
* Resolve metadata problems without replacing the phone.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### /deleteUsersPhone

Resets app cache and metadata for all players.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### /deleteUserPhone \[id]

Resets app cache and metadata for a specific player.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

This process clears app caches and metadata while preserving accounts, making it a situational but useful tool for administrators.
