# Send quick contact

In Quasar Smartphone PRO there is no command to give the contact or an exportable event, in this case we can access our Contacts application and in our letter we can directly send the phone number through the AirDrop system.

## **Give contact via AirDrop**

By swiping down on the phone, you can access the sliding menu, which includes a button for sharing contacts via AirDrop. This feature sends the contact to the nearest player, who will receive a notification and the contact in their Contacts app.
